## Problem Domain  
In many developing countries women and girls worldwide lack adequate facilities and resources for menstrual hygiene management (MHM). Challenges that many of these women and girls face does not extend solely to the availability of these resources and products, but also due to the institutionalized social norms and beliefs that place a stigma on menstrual health.

Millions of women in India face great challenges to managing their menstrual health and practicing menstrual hygiene. This is due to a number of enabling factors present in the country’s distribution system for products, income level, and social stigma. One of the largest factors is the lack of education and awareness to young women in the process of menstruation and its physiological basis pre-menarche (before a young girl’s first menstrual cycle). Another key issue is the availability of products to all income levels. The pricing of commercial products are expensive as well as inaccessible to women in rural areas, who account for a significant portion of the country’s population. Sanitation routines, attitudes, and most importantly, facilities, are also very underdeveloped across the country and limit access to functioning toilets and disposal solutions. This harms working women as well as school going young women, greatly increasing the gender income gap in income as well as academia.

Our group is interested in delving into the sociocultural root of this problem and finding correlations, insights, and potential solutions for dismantling these enabling factors. We will attempt to focus on the cause of these enabling factors and finding connections in data between socioeconomic backgrounds, income levels, religion, caste, etc.

## Analysis Questions

- Why do certain regions produce more positive responses towards progressive menstrual health education than others?

 Our team would like to know what key pieces in specific regions play a role in creating progressive environments that are more open to teaching/learning/providing menstrual health education and how this can be more effectively more widespread across India

- What policies are most effective in securing widespread access to feminine hygiene products in a more sexually conservative culture?

  One of the common roadblocks to providing education (and consequently access) to feminine hygiene projects is a culture where sex is considered taboo. This stigma has been alluded to in our domain analysis as a contributing factor to the problems faced by women in India, the population explored in our datasets.

- Is there a relationship between the female to male ratio and overall menstrual health?

  Societies that are heavily male dominated may not find the need for female menstrual health. Additionally, male dominated societies may not provide a safe space for women to talk about menstrual health.

- How are education levels associated with menstrual health and overall female health?

  In most developed countries, access to high quality education leads to better hygiene and healthcare. Having a physiological understanding of body processes as part of state-funded education would provide better understanding of hygiene routines, etc. Will this vary from state to state?

## Relevant Datasets

- PMA2020 Family Planning Survey Results
The Indian Institute of Health Management Research(IIHMR) is a specialized research university led by Principal Investigator  Dr. Anoop Khann, completed four rounds of the PMA 2020 family planning survey in Rajasthan between 2016 and 2018.
This data was obtained from
https://www.pmadata.org/countries/india#data-products-section-heading
This data was obtained from Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA) which is known to generate frequent, high-quality surveys monitoring key health indicators in nine countries in Africa and Asia.
Our group hopes that this data will help us interpret which regions based off of socioeconomic classifying question responses, reflect more positive attitudes towards progressive sexual health education.

- Percentage of Women Complication During Pregnancy
This data set describes the percentage of women who had pregnancy complications according to different reasons such as menstrual related problems or delivery complications
The data set was obtained from (https://data.gov.in/catalog/district-level-household-and-facility-survey-dlhs-4?filters%5Bfield_catalog_reference%5D=163828&format=json&offset=18&limit=6&sort%5Bcreated%5D=desc)
The data was obtained by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India. The data was collected via a nationwide survey in which Women answered a variety of questions.
This data would hopefully answer the question as to which policies are effective in women’s menstrual healthcare. This dataset provides information about individual districts which can be used jointly with another dataset to answer our questions.

- Menstrual Hygiene Scheme BUDGET 2016-2020
This dataset lists the budget for menstrual hygiene by state for select states in India.
Like the previous dataset, it was obtained from the same site and downloaded from https://data.gov.in/resources/stateut-wise-menstrual-hygiene-scheme-budget-approved-under-nhm-2016-17-2019-20-ministry
The data was released by Rajya Sabha (Council of States), the upper house of the Indian Parliament. The government is logically the entity responsible for proposing the budget, and the data was therefore effectively generated by them. It was released under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy.
This will help us identify the financial disparities in government menstrual health support programs by state, which can provide insight as to how attitudes toward and the overall state of female menstrual health differ by state and region.
